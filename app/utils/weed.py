    "Dandelion": {
        "scientific_name": "Taraxacum officinale",
        "description": "Dandelion is a common perennial weed with yellow flowers and a deep taproot. Despite being considered a weed, it has various culinary and medicinal uses.",
        "management": "Control methods include hand pulling (ensuring to remove the entire taproot), mowing before seed production, and applying selective herbicides. Maintaining a dense, healthy lawn can also help prevent dandelion establishment."
    },
    "Crabgrass": {
        "scientific_name": "Digitaria spp.",
        "description": "Crabgrass is an annual grass weed that emerges in late spring and thrives in hot, dry conditions. It has a prostrate growth habit and can quickly invade thin or stressed lawns and gardens.",
        "management": "Pre-emergent herbicides applied in early spring are effective. For established crabgrass, selective post-emergent herbicides can be used. Cultural practices like proper mowing height, adequate fertilization, and avoiding overwatering help prevent crabgrass."
    },
    "Bindweed": {
        "scientific_name": "Convolvulus arvensis",
        "description": "Field bindweed is a persistent perennial vine with white to pink funnel-shaped flowers. Its extensive root system makes it difficult to control, and it can quickly overtake gardens and agricultural fields.",
        "management": "Persistence is key for bindweed control. Regular removal of emerging shoots to deplete root reserves, covering with landscape fabric, and systemic herbicides are effective. Biological controls may also be available in some regions."
    },
    "Canada Thistle": {
        "scientific_name": "Cirsium arvense",
        "description": "Canada thistle is an aggressive perennial with spiny leaves and purple flowers. It spreads via seeds and an extensive root system, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings.",
        "management": "Integrated management approaches work best, including mechanical control (mowing before flowering), competitive crops, and systemic herbicides. Biological control agents may be available. Repeated treatments over multiple seasons are typically necessary."
    },
    "Chickweed": {
        "scientific_name": "Stellaria media",
        "description": "Common chickweed is a low-growing annual weed with small white flowers. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and can form dense mats that compete with desired plants.",
        "management": "Hand pulling or hoeing is effective for small infestations. Mulching can help prevent chickweed establishment. Pre-emergent herbicides can be used for larger areas, while post-emergent herbicides are effective on established plants."
    },
    "Nutsedge": {
        "scientific_name": "Cyperus spp.",
        "description": "Yellow and purple nutsedge are persistent perennial weeds that resemble grass but are actually sedges. They reproduce via seeds, rhizomes, and underground tubers (nutlets), making them difficult to control.",
        "management": "For effective control, remove young plants before they develop tubers. For established nutsedge, specialized herbicides are required. Improving drainage and avoiding overwatering can help prevent nutsedge problems."
    },
    "Purslane": {
        "scientific_name": "Portulaca oleracea",
        "description": "Purslane is a succulent annual weed with small yellow flowers. While considered a weed in many contexts, it is edible and nutritious, containing omega-3 fatty acids and various vitamins.",
        "management": "Hand pulling before seed production is effective. Mulching can prevent purslane establishment. If using herbicides, choose those labeled for purslane control and apply when plants are young."
    },
    "Poison Ivy": {
        "scientific_name": "Toxicodendron radicans",
        "description": "Poison ivy is a woody perennial vine or shrub that contains urushiol, an oil that causes allergic skin reactions in most people. It has compound leaves with three leaflets ('leaves of three, let it be').",
        "management": "When removing poison ivy, wear protective clothing, gloves, and eye protection. Never burn poison ivy as the smoke can carry urushiol. Cut vines and treat stumps with herbicide. Dispose of plants in sealed bags."
    },
    "Lambsquarters": {
        "scientific_name": "Chenopodium album",
        "description": "Lambsquarters is an annual weed with dusty-looking, light green leaves. It's a prolific seed producer and competes aggressively with crops for water and nutrients.",
        "management": "Cultivation and hand pulling are effective for small infestations. Pre-emergent herbicides help prevent germination, while post-emergent herbicides work on young plants. Mulching can suppress lambsquarters in gardens."
    },
    "Pigweed": {
        "scientific_name": "Amaranthus spp.",
        "description": "Pigweeds are annual weeds that can grow quite tall and produce thousands of seeds per plant. Several species have developed herbicide resistance, making them a significant agricultural challenge.",
        "management": "Early detection and removal before seed production is crucial. Shallow cultivation works for young plants. For larger infestations, use herbicides according to resistance management principles to prevent developing resistant populations."
    },
    "Unknown": {
        "scientific_name": "Not available",
        "description": "The weed could not be identified with sufficient confidence. Please upload a clearer image or consult with a local agricultural extension office for identification.",
        "management": "Since the weed could not be identified accurately, we cannot provide specific management recommendations. General weed management principles include proper identification, understanding the weed life cycle, and using integrated management approaches."
